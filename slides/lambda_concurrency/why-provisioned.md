### What does it mean?

To enable your function to scale without fluctuations in latency, use provisioned concurrency.

By allocating provisioned concurrency before an increase in invocations, you can ensure that all requests are served by initialized instances with very low latency.

You can configure provisioned concurrency on a version of a function, or on an alias.
